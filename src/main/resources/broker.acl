# Magentix2 Example of ACL file for Qpid Broker.
#
# Jose Miguel Such (jsuch@dsic.upv.es)
#
# In order for the Broker to load the acl file efficiently,
# please, remove the comments when the acl file is ready to be used.

# Queue Creation and Binding
# ----------------------------
# In order to allow agents to create their own queue and bind it to amq.direct,
# for each agent created include: 
# acl allow agentname@QPID all queue name=agentname
# acl allow agentname@QPID bind exchange name=amq.direct routingkey=agentname

# we can also allow all agents to create queues and bindings to amq.direct
# without constraints using the following two rules:
# acl allow all create queue
# acl allow all bind exchange name=amq.direct



# Communication prohibition
# --------------------------
# In order to not allow agent1 to communicate to agent2, include
# at this point of the ACL file and always before Magentix2 default rules:
#
# acl deny agent1@QPID publish exchange name=amq.direct routingkey=agent2
#



# Magentix2 default rules
# --------------------------
#
# The following rule allows all agents to consume messages from their own queues:

acl allow all consume queue owner=self

# The following rule allows all agents in Magentix to communicate to each other,
# unless a communication prohibition is stated before this rule.

acl allow all publish exchange name=amq.direct

# MMS agent default rules
# --------------------------
# In order to allow MMS comunicate to broker and execute method reload ACL File  
acl allow MMS@QPID all queue
acl allow MMS@QPID all exchange name=amq.direct
acl allow MMS@QPID all exchange name=qpid.management
acl allow MMS@QPID all method name=reloadACLFile

# Management Trace Agent default rule
# -------------------------------------
# In order to allow traceManager comunicate to broker and execute method reload ACL File and access to exchange amq.match

acl allow tm@QPID all queue name=tm
acl allow tm@QPID all exchange name=amq.direct routingkey=tm
acl allow tm@QPID all queue name=tm.trace
acl allow tm@QPID all exchange name=amq.match 
acl allow tm@QPID all exchange name=qpid.management
acl allow tm@QPID all method name=reloadACLFile
